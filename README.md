# Dissertation-Template
LaTeX Dissertation Template for York University

This template was originally created by Toni Kunic (https://github.com/tkunic) for his Master's thesis, and then was cleaned up and generalized as a template by Calden Wloka.

Note that as of 2019 this template is up to date with the FGS formatting requirements at York University. If requirements change in the future, please submit those changes to ensure this template stays up to date.

## Expected usage:

The template is designed to be compiled from `main.tex`, with each chapter populated via subdocuments located in `sec/`.
